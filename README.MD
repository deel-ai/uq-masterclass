# üöÄ Welcome to the **Uncertainty Quantification DEEL Master Class** !

Predictive uncertainty quantification in machine learning aims to assess the predictive error of models as precisely as possible, and in some cases, to calibrate this error according to specific statistical targets. Among various approaches, Conformal Prediction stands out due to its strong theoretical properties and ease of implementation and integration in production environments. 

This repository gathers materials from DEEL master class to acquire theoretical and practical knowledge about uncertainty quantification, and more specifically conformal prediction. Through these resources, you'll understand the key concepts, learn to apply them using PUNCC library across various examples, and develop the skills to interpret results and select suitable algorithms for real-world applications.
